Customer segmentation using K-Means for retail analytics

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers of a retail store based on Age, Gender, Annual Income, and Spending Score. After preprocessing the data by encoding categorical variables and normalizing features, the optimal number of clusters (K=5) was determined using the Elbow method. The model groups customers into five distinct clusters, providing insights into their spending patterns and demographics. Visualizations created with Seaborn illustrate the clusters and their characteristics.
